# Equally Strong

call two arms equally strong if the heaviest weights they each are able to lift are equal.

Call tow people equally strong if their strongest arms equally strong (the strongest arm can be the right and the left), and so are their weakest arms.

Given your and your frien's arms'lifting capabilities find out if you are equally strong.

### Example

- For yourLeft = 10, yourRight = 15, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 10, the output should be areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;
- For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 10, the output should be areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;
- For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 9, the output should be areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true; 

### Hints
