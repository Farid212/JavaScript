Several people standing in a riw and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into the team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 and fourth into team 2 and so on.

### Example

For array = [50, 60, 60, 45, 70], the out put should be alternatingSums(array) = [180, 105]

### Input/Output

- **[time limit] 4000 ms**
- **[input] array.integer array**

Guaranteed constraints:

1 <= array.length <= 10

45 <= array[i] <= 100

**[output] array.integer**
